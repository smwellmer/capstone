## Project Description

I am developing a full-stack eCommerce site for my mom's cafe. She already uses Square payment processing, so I wanted to incorporate that in the website for her business. Depending on how intensive the Square portion will be, I also had thoughts of trying to use Next.JS for my front-end.
As of right now, my architecture is planned out using React. 

## API

[Square API](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square)



## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

- [WireFrame](https://app.moqups.com/nW8lRqOM9H/edit/page/ad64222d5)

	--> on the left side is the "Pages" tab with all the different page views and the Architecture.
